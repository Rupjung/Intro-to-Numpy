Introduction to NumPy
NumPy (Numerical Python) is a powerful Python library that handles mathematical and numerical operations efficiently.

The main function of NumPy is to work with large, multi-dimensional arrays and to perform complex mathematical operations between them.

Before NumPy, numerical operations in Python relied on lists. The introduction of NumPy arrays enhanced computational speed and efficiency considerably. 

The transition from Python lists to NumPy arrays alone can boost performance by up to 100 times.

Therefore, NumPy is a valuable asset in data science.
