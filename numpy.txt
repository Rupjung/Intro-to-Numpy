Introduction to NumPy
NumPy (Numerical Python) is a powerful Python library that handles mathematical and numerical operations efficiently.

The main function of NumPy is to work with large, multi-dimensional arrays and to perform complex mathematical operations between them.

Before NumPy, numerical operations in Python relied on lists. The introduction of NumPy arrays enhanced computational speed and efficiency considerably. 

The transition from Python lists to NumPy arrays alone can boost performance by up to 100 times.

Therefore, NumPy is a valuable asset in data science.

It has a data structure called ndarray, which is the reason behind NumPy's efficiency.

NumPy arrays are homogeneous, meaning they can only store elements of the same data type, enabling efficient storage and computation.

Note: We prefer NumPy arrays over Python lists because they are implemented in C, which makes them faster and more efficient than lists.
 Also, NumPy supports vectorized operations, which means mathematical operations can be applied on entire arrays at once.
